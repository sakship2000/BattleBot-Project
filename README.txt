This is the source code for my computer graphics assignment! In this assignment, we were told to model a battle bot in OpenGL given a picture. The bot is interactive and can be controlled using keyboard keys. Applying simple geometric transformations, the bot can move forwards and backwards, turn and activate its weapon. 
This is a field I'm truly interested in and will definitely take more courses in, in the years to come. 

COMPILATION To compile, use the following command: g++ ArmFlipper.cpp QuadMesh.cpp -o ArmFlipper -framework OpenGL -framework GLUT

HELP KEY After running the program, press ‘F1’ to see the instructions on how to interact with the battle bot. The instructions will appear on the console window.
